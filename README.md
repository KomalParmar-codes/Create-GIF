# Create-GIF
Create GIF from Multiple Images using Python
# Overview 
This project demonstrates how to generate an animated GIF from multiple image files using Python. It is ideal for anyone learning image processing, basic automation, or Python scripting. The script reads images, resizes them to a consistent shape, and creates a smooth GIF using the imageio and PIL libraries.
# Technologies Used
1. Python 3
2. imageio
3. Pillow (PIL)
4. NumPy

# How to Run
1. Install Required Libraries
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
pip install imageio Pillow numpy
2. Place Your Images
Ensure your image files (e.g., .png, .jpg) are in the same directory as GIF.py.
3. Run the Script
Execute the script:
python GIF.py
4. Output
A file named team.gif will be generated in the same directory.

# Educational Purpose
